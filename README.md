**Business Problem:**
XYZ employs around 4,410 people but faces a high attrition rate of 16.12%, impacting project timelines, productivity, and reputation. The company seeks an analysis to determine the root causes of this turnover and implement strategies to reduce it.

**Methodology:**
1.	Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and relevance. Columns containing categorical responses (e.g., Yes/No) were converted into binary numerical values (1/0) for better analysis.
2.	Regression Analysis in Excel: A preliminary regression analysis was conducted to explore relationships between key factors (such as monthly income and attrition). While these results provide a foundation, further statistical validation is recommended to interpret findings.

3.	Data Visualization in Tableau: The dataset was imported into Tableau, where calculated fields and filters (such as gender) were created to generate meaningful insights. Various charts, including doughnut and column charts, were used to visualize the relationships between attrition and key variables like department, age group, and monthly income.

**Results:**
1.	Key Performance Indicators (KPI):
•  Employee Count: 4,410
•  Attrition Count: 711 (16.12%)
•  Average Monthly Income: Assessed for its relation to attrition.
•  Working Years: The average of 11 years indicates general retention but shows higher turnover in the early years.
2.	Attrition by Department (Doughnut Chart): The Research and Development department has the highest attrition rate, accounting for 63.71% of total attrition, while Human Resources and Sales departments have significantly lower rates at 8.02% and 28.27%, respectively. This indicates that the Research and Development department requires urgent attention to curb employee turnover.
3.	Attrition by Age Group (Column Chart with Trend Lines): The highest attrition is observed among employees aged 28-32, with approximately 80-100 employees leaving within this age range. Attrition significantly decreases in employees aged 40 and above, suggesting that younger employees are more likely to leave. This trend emphasizes the need for retention strategies targeted at employees in their late 20s and early 30s.
4.	Total Working Years by Department table highlights that the majority of employees leaving the company in all departments have been employed for 0 to 5 years. Specifically: 
•	Research & Development: 141 employees left with 0 years, and 155 employees left with 5 years of service.
•	Sales: 66 employees left with both 0 and 5 years of service.
•	Human Resources: 17 employees left with 0 years, and 24 employees left with 5 years of service.
This indicates a significant trend where employees with fewer years of service tend to leave the company more frequently, with a sharp decline in attrition as the number of working years increases beyond 10. 

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**
•	Research and Development is the most affected department and requires immediate intervention to retain skilled talent.
•	Younger employees (aged 28-32) are at higher risk of leaving.
•	Targeted retention programs, such as bonuses, mentorship, and career development, should be introduced to reduce attrition among employees with fewer than five years of service.
